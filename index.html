    <h1>Urge Wyoming Officials to Acquire a C-130J Flight Simulator</h1>
    <p>This page helps you send a policy request to Wyoming's key officials, similar to advocacy campaigns by groups like the NRA. The goal: Support funding and approval for a C-130J and/or UH-60M simulator to boost training for the Wyoming Air National Guard's 153rd Airlift Wing, create jobs, and strengthen state readiness.</p>

Dear [Official's Name],

The Wyoming Air National Guard’s 153rd Airlift Wing is converting to eight C-130Js in 2028, yet Cheyenne is about to lose its legacy C-130H simulator—reportedly relocating to Little Rock AFB. Without action, Wyoming will have zero on-site C-130 training capability at the exact moment we need it most.

A new C-130J full-motion simulator in Cheyenne would:

- End costly TDY trips to Arkansas ($3,500–$5,000 per airman)

- Cut training costs 60–70% while dramatically increasing readiness

- Serve Wyoming, Montana (120th AW), Minnesota (133rd AW), Colorado (140th/302nd Wings), and active-duty units at Dyess—freeing overloaded schoolhouse simulators at Little Rock

Additionally, the same facility could host a UH-60M Black Hawk simulator for the Wyoming Army National Guard, creating a true Joint Aircrew Training Center of Excellence for the entire state.

Please:

- Appropriate $2–3M in state matching funds for site preparation

- Work with our congressional delegation to place the Cheyenne C-130J (and optional UH-60M) simulator on the FY27 NDAA unfunded priorities list

- Let’s keep Wyoming’s airmen and soldiers training at home instead of sending them—and their simulators—out of state.

Thank you for supporting our Guard.
